VThe dislocation core energy is a mathematical construct designed to remove the singularity in the stress and strain fields of elasticity theory. The total strain energy is computed relative to the cohesive energy of the ideal crystal, and the core energy is the portion of this energy that is not accounted for by an elastic model. In this property, the dislocation core energy for cubic crystals at zero temperature and a given stress state is reported using three different elastic models: nonsingular, isotropic, and anisotropic. Each of these core energies is computed for a range of dislocation core cutoff radii and is given in units of energy per unit dislocation line length.

VEnthalpy of mixing per atom versus concentration for a random solid solution binary alloy of species A and B at constant pressure and temperature. The enthalpy of mixing per atom is defined as the enthalpy of the binary alloy less the enthalpies of each species in the same crystal structure normalized by the number of atoms. This property is defined for the case where at zero concentration the crystal consists entirely of A atoms, and at concentration one, the crystal is entirely of species B. At each concentration the potential energy of the binary alloy is minimized.

VEnthalpy of mixing per atom versus concentration for a random solid solution binary alloy of species A and B at constant volume and temperature. The enthalpy of mixing per atom is defined as the enthalpy of the binary alloy less the enthalpies of each species in the same crystal structure normalized by the number of atoms. This property is defined for the case where at zero concentration the crystal consists entirely of A atoms, and at concentration one, the crystal is entirely of species B. At each concentration the potential energy of the binary alloy is minimized.

VThe relaxed energy-per-area versus all possible slips lying in the (111) lattice plane defines the Gamma surface. Due to periodicity of the crystal lattice, it suffices to sample a grid of points that span  a*sqrt(6)/2 and a*sqrt(2)/2  along the [112] and [-110] directions, respectively. This is achieved through a sequence of rigid displacements applied to one part of an fcc crystal relative to another on the (111) plane on a grid defined by the [112] and [-110] directions at zero temperature and a specified pressure. Following each slip displacement, a relaxation of the atomic coordinates is performed in the direction perpendicular to the slip plane to arrive at the energy-per-area.

VThe verification check category. There are three possibilities: `informational', `consistency', and `mandatory'. Informational verification checks provide useful information about the model that have no implications regarding its internal consistency. Consistency verification checks test for violations of internal consistency (e.g. the forces are not the negative gradient of the energy). Mandatory verification checks test for failures of a model to satisfy critical KIM API requirements or declared capabilities (such as supporting a specified species).

VEach verification check returns a grade indicating how well the test was passed.  The type of grade returned is defined by the vc-grade-basis. There are two options: `graded' and `passfail'. A `graded' verification check returns a letter grade `A', `B', `C', `D' or `F' (where `A' is best, and `F' indicated failure). A `passfail' verification check returns `P' for pass, or `F' for fail. In situations where the verification check could not be performed, a value of `N/A' (for not available) must be returned.

VEquilibrium structure of a crystal at a given temperature and applied stress. The equilibrium structure is expressed as an AFLOW prototype label and its corresponding free parameters representing the average positions of the constituent atoms. Multiple instances of this property with different free parameters may be reported for a given AFLOW prototype label, representing different local stable or unstable equilibria. There is no guarantee that any instance of this property represents the state of minimum Helmholtz free energy of this system, not even when the configuration space is restricted to the specified crystal prototype label.

The numerical value of the stress tensor of a test result or reference data may be different due to tolerance, and can be checked by inspecting the output files of the test or the reference data description. The components should be expressed in the same coordinate system as the structure specified by prototype-label and parameter-values, with the orientation of lattice vectors defined in M. J.

VEquilibrium crystal structure and binding potential energy at zero temperature and applied stress
p4309
sVproperty-description
p4310
VEquilibrium structure and energy of a crystal at zero temperature and applied stress. The equilibrium structure is expressed as an AFLOW prototype label and its corresponding free parameters. The equilibrium may be stable or unstable (not reported in this property). Multiple instances of this property with different free parameters may be reported for a given AFLOW prototype label, representing different stable or unstable equilibria. There is no guarantee that any instance of this property is the ground state of this system, not even when the configuration space is restricted to the specified crystal prototype label.\u000a\u000a\u000a  The reported binding potential energy is the energy required to decompose the solid into its individual constituent particles isolated from each other. This is defined as the energy of the crystal less the energies of the isolated constituent particles. \u000a\u000a\u000a  Two values are reported, the `binding-potential-energy-per-atom` is the average energy per atom in the unit cell, the `binding-potential-energy-per-formula` is the energy per chemical formula, which reflects the relative ratio of elements in the primitive unit cell of the crystal. For a crystal containing a single chemical element (regardless of structure) this is the same as the `binding-potential-energy-per-atom`, e.g. for hcp Mg the chemical formula is Mg and the 'binding-potential-energy-per-formula' is per magnesium atom (even though the hcp primitive unit cell contains two atoms). For compounds the 'binding-potential-energy-per-formula' will depend on the stoichiometric formula, e.g. for MoS_2 (AB2-type compound) the energy is per MoS_2 unit (i.e. 3 times larger than the `binding-potential-energy-per-atom` value). The reported energies are actual energies (not the negative of the energy as commonly reported), therefore these values will be negative for a crystal that is more stable than its isolated constituents.
